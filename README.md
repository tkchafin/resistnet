# autoStreamTree
Automated pipeline for examining patterns of genetic differentiation in stream networks

--In progress--

## Software Description
autoStreamTree is a Python software package providing various analyses aimed at analyzing patterns of genetic differentiation among aquatic stream-dwelling organisms. The intention is to take what was previously a tedious process involving multiple discrete steps and to integrate these all in one place. 

Currently, autoStreamTree provides a companion library of functions for calculating various measures of genetic distances among individuals or populations, including model-corrected p-distances (e.g. Jukes-Cantor 1969, Kimura 2-parameter, Tamura-Nei 1993) as well as those based on allele frequencies (e.g. Theta-ST, linearized Fst, Jost's D -- full list of available distance models below). It also includes integrated functions for parsing an input vector shapefile of streams (see below 'Requirements for input shapefiles') for easy calculation of pairwise stream distances between sites, as well as the least-squares fitting of reach-wise genetic distances according to the "stream tree" model of Kalinowski et al. (2008). Various plotting functions are also provided for downstream analysis, including looking at patterns of isolation-by-distance. Outputs should also be directly importable into R, with additional outputs with annotated streamtree fitted distances provided for analysis in your GIS suite of choice. 

If you use this package for analysis of fitted distances using the streamtree model, please cite the following:
